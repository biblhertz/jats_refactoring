# Scripts to prepare JATS files for inDesign XML import
With the provided `biblio2.py` script and the `htmlbiblio2xml.xslt` stylesheet, you have a comprehensive workflow for converting a BibTeX bibliography to an XML format suitable for InDesign, following an intermediate HTML conversion step (for the bibliography). To coordinate this with your JATS article processing (`article2indesign.py`) and the eventual merging of the article and bibliography into a final document.
With the `combine.py` script, you now have a complete workflow for processing a JATS article, converting a bibliography into XML, and combining both into a single XML document ready for InDesign. This script effectively merges the article and bibliography XML files by appending the bibliography to the `<back>` section of the article XML.

### Automated Workflow

1. **Process the JATS Article**: First, use `article2indesign.py` to transform the JATS XML with the provided XSLT and create an InDesign-ready XML document.

2. **Convert the Bibliography**: Next, run `biblio2.py` to convert the bibliography from BibTeX to XML, applying the necessary transformations.

3. **Merge Article and Bibliography**: Finally, use `combine.py` to merge the XML outputs from the first two steps into a single XML document.


## Single steps:

### Step 1: Process JATS Article
First, use `article2indesign.py` to process the JATS article. This script applies an XSLT transformation to the JATS XML and outputs a minified and transformed XML file ready for InDesign. The existing references are ignored.

``` bash
```

### Step 2: Convert Bibliography
Next, run `biblio2.py` to convert the BibTeX file into an XML format via an intermediate HTML representation. This involves:
- Converting the BibTeX file to HTML using Pandoc with a specified CSL style.
- Applying an XSLT transformation to the HTML to produce the final XML bibliography.

### Step 3: Merge Article and Bibliography
Finally, `combine.py` script helps to merge the XML outputs from Steps 1 and 2. This script will:
- Load the XML file generated by `article2indesign.py`.
- Load the XML bibliography file generated by `biblio2.py`.
- Combine these XML documents into a single XML file that integrates the article content with the bibliography in the desired structure for InDesign.

## Prerequisites

### External Tools
- **Pandoc**: A universal document converter, used in `biblio2.py` for converting BibTeX files to HTML.
  - Installation instructions can be found on the [Pandoc installation page](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
- **Python**: The programming language in which your scripts are written. Ensure you have Python installed to run the scripts.
  - Python can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Python Libraries
- **lxml**: For parsing, creating, and saving XML documents. Used in all your Python scripts for handling XML and XSLT transformations.
  - Installation command: `pip install lxml`
- **argparse**: For parsing command-line arguments in your scripts. This is a standard library module in Python, so no additional installation should be required for Python versions 2.7 and 3.2 and above.
- **subprocess**: For running external commands (e.g., calling other scripts or running Pandoc). This is also part of Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

### Additional Considerations
- Ensure that the **XSLT processor** used by `lxml` for XSLT transformations is compatible with your XSLT scripts. `lxml` typically uses `libxslt` which is compatible with XSLT 1.0 and partially compatible with XSLT 2.0 features. Your XSLT scripts should be compatible with the processor's capabilities.
- **XML Formatter**: While not a separate dependency, your `article2indesign.py` script uses `xmlformatter`, which is not a standard library and seems to be a custom or third-party tool. The actual dependency used in your script for formatting is `lxml`, so ensure that any reference to `xmlformatter` aligns with the libraries you have installed.
- **Operating System**: Ensure that your operating system supports these tools and libraries. The installation commands and methods may vary depending on whether you are using Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Installation Summary
To summarize, here are the basic installation commands you might need:

```bash
# Install lxml
pip install lxml
pip install xmlformatter

# Install Pandoc (follow the specific instructions for your OS)
```

Ensure that Python is installed and that you can run `python` or `python3` from your command line or terminal. Also, verify that Pandoc is correctly installed by running `pandoc --version`.

Understood, if `xmlformatter` is essential for your workflow to achieve the desired level of compression and formatting that `lxml` doesn't provide out of the box, then it's indeed a necessary dependency. 


Before running this command, make sure you have pip installed and up to date. This command assumes that `xmlformatter` refers to a package available in PyPI that meets your requirements for XML minification and formatting.

### Adjusting the Dependency List

Given this clarification, here's the updated list of dependencies for your project:

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `lxml` for XML parsing and XSLT transformations.
    - `pip install lxml`
  - `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments (included with Python).
  - `subprocess` for running external commands (included with Python).
  - `xmlformatter` for minifying and formatting XML content.
    - `pip install xmlformatter`

- **External Tools:**
  - **Pandoc** for converting BibTeX files to HTML.
    - Installation instructions can be found on the [Pandoc installation page](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
